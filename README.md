Sea surface temperature prediction holds utmost importance in numerous domains, such as **marine ecology, fisheries management, and climate change** research at the topmost ranks, amongst infinite others. Real-time sea surface forecasts depend on **fluid dynamics and thermodynamics laws**, accounting for factors like boundaries and initial conditions. This implies that these models are more fitting for the prediction of temperatures over a larger area, rather than categorical and pinpoint locations. During this research, Deep Learning Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM) with numerical estimators (e.g., confusion matrices) were utilized at various geographical coordinates for various time durations (daily, weekly, and monthly).

The aim was to first derive and study the forecasts made by traditional neural networks, gather insights, and then apply deep learning networks. An improvement in the results was expected once deep learning neural networks (specifically, **Long Short-Term Memory LSTM**) were applied over the selected coordinates. The aspiration is to reach a **very high correlation** value, which would help with accuracy and minimization of errors. The study also aims to conduct a comparative study, using the **ARIMA, Regression, and Classifications **models with an external validation input, out of which is expected that the LSTM model will come out on top, due to its ability to learn and memorize long term and extracting features and patterns from the data.
